Description:
Problem: The traveling salesman problem (TSP) aims to find the shortest route that
visits each city in a list exactly once and returns to the starting city.
The difficulty lies in the exponential growth of possible routes as the number of cities
increases. With just 10 cities there are over 3.6 million possible routes, making brute-force approaches intractable.
There are multiple algorithms to solve TSP like,
1. Constructive Heuristics
● Nearest Neighbor
● Greedy Algorithm
2. Local Search Heuristics
● 2-Opt
● k-Opt
3. Metaheuristics
● Simulated Annealing
● Tabu Search
● Genetic Algorithms
● Ant Colony Optimization
From all these ways to solve TSP, we choose to compare Local Search Heuristics 2-Opt
algorithms Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. These uses, leverage
probabilistic transitions and bio-inspired operators respectively to search the huge
solution space.
The goal is to develop a program that visualizes the working of the implemented TSP
solvers and compares their time on varying problem sizes. This will provide insight into
their relative performance as the problem scale increases.
By focusing on visualizing and comparing heuristic techniques, we can better
understand how to balance solution quality and computational resources when
approximating solutions for large traveling salesman instances.
